# fun_projects

This repo will contain couple of python codes that I will write just to learn and do fun stuff.

1. Lifecircel.py

This code will draw rectangles for the total number of years you expect to live. All of your lived years will be red rectangle and 
all yet-to-live years will be green colored.
